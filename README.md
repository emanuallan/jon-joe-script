<h1 align="center">Joe's New Balance Shoe Tracker Script</h1>


<div align="center">
A python script that uses the Selenium and ChromeDriver module to crawl New Balance's outlet store website, Joe's, and checks for price changes and new arrivals, as well as, removals amongst sneakers and clothing and exports them as a .csv file.
</div>

## üç≠ Characteristics
- Checks for price changes (+/-)
- Checks for new shoe arrivals
- Checks for shoe removals
- Exports into .csv file


## üì¶ Installation & Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/emanuallan/jon-joe-script.git
```
- Go to 
  - MEN: https://www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com/men/shoes/?Categories=men&Categories=shoes&PriceRange=&OnSale=&Icon=&Brand=0&PageSize=800&Page=1&Branded=False&ListType=Grid&Text=&Sorting=TopPicks
  - WOMEN: https://www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com/women/shoes/?Categories=women&Categories=shoes&PriceRange=&OnSale=&Icon=&Brand=0&PageSize=800&Page=1&Branded=False&ListType=Grid&Text=&Sorting=TopPicks
- Select your size
- Copy the URL at the top
- Go into search script.py and replace the link at the bottom of the file in the `CheckProducts` method with the link you copied
- Run the script
  - The script grabs the new information scraped from the web and compares it to the .csv file that it already stored within the directory.
  - Therefore, everytime you run the script the .csv file is overwritten (As a result, the very first time you run the script, it is just a simple collection of data, from then on out you can keep up with the changes by running the script)


## üî® What's Next?
- Creating an executable that takes in user input to generate the link needed
- Script currently has to run for clothing seperately, will change so that both shoes and clothing are covered in one run
